I am Multi-faceted software techie. In all the roles I have played, I have always looked for patterns of improvements. I am problem solver at heart.

These are my 3 key takeaways in any project that I have worked on
* Analysing the pros and cons and limitations of tools before choosing it.
* Understand scope of effectiveness. Choose approaches/algorithms/design decisions that are most effective.
* Use design patterns to make code easy, re-useable and maintainable.

### Analyse PROs and CONs before choosing a tool

Every tool/algorithm has pros and cons. We should have a basic understanding of the project needs and choose the tools that suits our needs. [Here is how I did it for the project that I was working on](https://sswaroop.medium.com/how-taiko-compares-to-other-browser-automation-tools-945e18ea1e22) to validate the claims made in the blog.

### Understand scope of effectiveness

Unit tests, Integration tests, Functional/UI tests are the most common kind of tests that the software community is familiar with. However, each have their scope where it can be used effectively. After analysing that we needed a differnt approach to write tests effectively, I wrote the [subcutaneous tests](https://github.com/getgauge/gauge-lsp-tests)

### Recognise anti-patterns and write maintainable code.

There are several design patterns that structure tests for re-use and maintainability. Here is my take on [recognising anti-patterns and writing maintainable test code](https://medium.com/getgauge/are-page-objects-anti-pattern-21b6e337880f)
